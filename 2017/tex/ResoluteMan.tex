\chapter{Resolute Man}

	The Resolute Man membership development program is similar to an idea that our past president, Kris Sabatini, had drafted up to benefit our brothers throughout their career as undergraduates. In order to start us off on the right foot during our Spring 2017 retreat all brothers started their Resolute Man application and it was explained to them what was explicitly required of them.
	
	\section*{Marshal Process}
	
	At the start of the Marshal process when the Marshal is signing up the candidates for OmegaFi he also signed them up for Resolute Man as of the Spring 2017 semester. Using the Resolute Man program as a guide the Marshal leads the candidates through the knowledge of $\Theta$X and explains the values of the program. In essence the Marshal process is the first stepping stone in the career as a $\Theta$X.
	
	\section*{Membership Development Chair}  
    
    In previous years the Membership Development Chair has not had a ton of guidance as to what events to run and how to best help the brothers, but the Resolute Man program has changed that. The Membership Development Chair, Jeremy Zalles, has been using the checklist as a outline for what he should be coordinating throughout the semester. With that in mind we have been able to run events that fit the needs of the majority of brothers and focusing specifically on brothers shooting for the award.
