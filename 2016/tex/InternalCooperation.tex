\chapter{Internal Cooperation}
  The past two semesters, we have seen an increase in Beta Nu’s endeavors to reach out and involve itself with International Headquarters and local chapters. 
  
  \section*{Conferences}
  
    Among the staple conferences are our chapter endeavors to attend, such as the Sasser's Presidential Conference and Mid-Year Leadership Conference. Our chapter has sent brothers to several local and international conferences. Our chapter president, Kris Sabatini, attended Sasser's while our whole EC made it to this year's MYLC at Kentucky. CWRU's fall semester Greek Life Academy program featured a training program for Case Greek Life members; two brothers attended- Nikhil Edward and Jack LaRue. Meanwhile, our chapter sent several brothers to Theta Chi's Initiative Academy, last summer taking Matthew Bentley, David Lance, Matthew Trowbridge, and Zachary Williams, where Beta Nu was awarded Chapter Excellence for the 2014-2015 school year. We value the leadership development opportunities these conferences can provide, as many of those who attended are now elected officers for the chapter. We intend on continuing to send brothers to the Initiative Academy and UIFI this summer. Lastly, our chapter will be sending brothers to the 160th Anniversary National Convention. \\
    
    As in previous semesters, we hosted a field executive, Brother Bryce Ellis. Brother Ellis performed checklists and surveys of our chapter to help facilitate our growth.  He scheduled meetings with our Greek Life Advisor, chapter executive board, and he held a chapter workshop. We look forward to hosting him again and learning tools to help our chapter grow. \\
    
    Finally, we plan on continuing the success of our alumni relations event that involved the international fraternity, OX Roast. We hosted Darnell Parker, former advisor to the Missouri chapter, board member of the Syracuse chapter, and current administrator at CWRU at our OX Roast. In the past, we have hosted the National Vice-President, Secretary, President, and several notable speakers. 
    
  \section*{Local Cooperation}
    Our chapter has made it a point of pride to maintain close relationships with the Beta Lambda chapter of the University of Akron and the Delta Theta chapter of the University of Toledo. In the past, we have frequently attended Beta Lambda's initiation, and they have done the same for our initiation. With their chapter's rebooting, we made ourselves available to them, attending one of their philanthropy events in support of the new brothers. \\
    
    With the assistance of our chapter advisor Daniel Neumann, Beta Nu has finally built up enough money in the Chapter-Specific Scholarship Fund that we are now able to award two \$500 scholarships per year.
