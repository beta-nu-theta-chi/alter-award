\chapter{Campus Involvement}

  Our brothers are leading and participating in a variety of initiatives throughout campus. Though a large amount of our involvement throughout the campus has been highlighted in other sections, the following list summarizes more of what we do. A superscript ``1'' denotes that brothers have one or more leadership positions within an organization. A superscript ``2`` denotes that our brothers either founded the organization or are active as a president of the organization. For some organizations, we have included a short description.
